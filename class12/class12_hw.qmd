## Read the table into R

```{r}
gene_exp_table <- read.table("rs8067378.txt") 
head(gene_exp_table) 
summary(gene_exp_table) 

```

```{r}
table(gene_exp_table$geno)
```

## Create a boxplot. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(gene_exp_table) +
  aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="Genotype", y="Expression", title= "Expression by Genotype")  
```

>Q14: A/A seems to have a higher expression than G/G based on the boxplot. The SNP does seem to affect expression as there is large difference between the two homozygous alleles.
